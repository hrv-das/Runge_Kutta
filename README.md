# Runge_Kutta
This repository contains Python codes developed by me to solve differential equations using 3rd and 4th order Runge-Kutta Method.  
I have used 3rd and 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve the following initial value problem:  
$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \lambda y$  
with $y(0) = 1$ and $\lambda = \pm 3$. The range of the independent variable $t$ is from $t = 0$ to $t = 10$. I have used two step sizes, $h = 0.5$ and $h = 0.1$  
A comparison of the numerical solution with the exact analytical solution is also done and illustrated with the help of plots.
